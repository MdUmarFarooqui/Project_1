# Project Title

Creating a Simple Calculator using GUI and Tkinter

## Description

Crafting a professional calculator application using Tkinter, offering users a user-friendly interface for basic calculations, featuring a clean design with a responsive layout, an entry widget for displaying and inputting numbers, and buttons for digits, basic operations, and error handling for a seamless user experience.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Visual Code Studio, Python and Tkinter module to run the program smoothly.
### Using Mac OS

## Approach

Creating a calculator application using Tkinter, a Python GUI library, providing a straightforward interface for users to perform calculations with ease.

## Executing program (Steps)

#### 1. Created a Tkinter-based GUI for the calculator application.

#### 2. Implemented the necessary logic to perform basic arithmetic operations.
      
Implementing the necessary logic to perform basic arithmetic operations involves creating functions or methods that execute addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user input. In the context of a calculator application using Tkinter, this typically includes the following steps:

#### User Input Handling:
Capture user input from the GUI elements, such as buttons or an entry widget, representing digits and mathematical operations.

#### Parsing and Validation:
Parse the user input to extract numerical values and the selected operation.
Validate the input to ensure it follows a valid format for arithmetic operations, handling potential errors gracefully.

#### Arithmetic Operations:
Implement functions or methods to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on the parsed user input.
Ensure that the operations are accurate and handle edge cases, such as division by zero.

##### Updating Display:
Update the GUI display, such as an entry widget, to reflect the ongoing calculations and results.
Here's a simplified example in Python using functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division:

#### 3. Handled user input and ensured accurate display of calculation results.

## Key Features

#### Calculator UI:
1. Entry widget for input and display.
2. Clear ("C") button for resetting.
3. "=" button for result calculation.

#### Grid Layout:
Buttons arranged in a grid for organized presentation.
